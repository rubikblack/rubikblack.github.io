The BAS was setup as “installed” at the MP and the Comm 3 LLID lost communications with the BAS for 15 contiguous minutes after it had been established. Refer to Section on Setpoint Arbitration to determine how setpoints and operating modes may be effected by the comm loss. The chiller follows the value of the Tracer Default Run Command which can be previously written by Tracer and stored nonvolatilely by the MP (either use local or shutdown).</td>
